Instructions:

Spend a few moments looking over the files in B-Final-App.
1. Get the server running
2. Begin dissecting the javascript code found at the bottom of add.html
3. Explain to your neighbor:
    a. What the code does
    b. What it is for
    c. Why it is relevant to the application
    d. Be sure to highlight the $.post code functionality in your explanation

FYI: Express has a built-in application generator that will create all the files,
directories that you need and put a package.json file in place.  Check it out at
